# Coursera AI for Medicine Specialization (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments, labs and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

**Instructors**: `Pranav Rajpurkar`, `Bora Uyumazturk`, `Amirhossein Kiani` and `Eddy Shyu`.

## Specialization Info

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. In this Specialization, you’ll gain practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. You’ll learn how to:

- Diagnose diseases from X-Rays and 3D MRI brain images
- Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
- Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials
- Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing
